# CAR PARKING CPP PROJECT #

- This is my project as a part of C++ course.
- It uses libraries like vectors, chrono and some standard libraries.
- This is a basic car parking model which have sections like parkCar(), retrieveCar(), displayParkingStatus().
- As the names suggest parkCar() is used for parking the car displayParkingStatus() is used for displaying the parking slots whether they are full or empty and retrieveCar() is used to retrievethe car and calculate the amt based on the time used and it dynamically calculates the amt using chrone function.
